Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kundan Singh
Description: This package provides a general quantile-based algorithm for
    generating progressively Type-II censored samples from continuous lifetime
    distributions. It is designed for simulation studies in reliability
    analysis, life-testing experiments, and survival analysis under
